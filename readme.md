Here in this project,, i've made a very simple and easy to understand CRUD Application which can store Users data and can perform other CRUD oPERATIONS ALSO

Steps to Run this program are:

1. Extract this folder into your local system.
2. open your Xampp server and import the database provided in the folder mentioned above.
3. Opne your code editor like VSCODE or any editor which contains the functionality of opening terminal/cmd on it.
4. Now open the folder there.... and opne the terminal there also
5. Now split the terminal into two parts
6. In First part write these COMMANDS as:
        "cd client"
        "npm start"
7. In second part write these COMMANDS as:
        "cd server"
        "node index.js"

That;s it... Enjoy
